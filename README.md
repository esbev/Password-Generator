# Week 3 Challenge - Password Generator

## Description

This website was built so a user might get a unique password created for them. The code allows a user to choose from a preset list of different options of character types to include for the password creation. The code then takes the user's input to generate a random and unique password. When the user is finished and has been given a new password the user may repeat this process as needed.

## Special Thanks

Thanks goes out to all the instructors and teacher assistants for their clear instruction and prompt and thorough answers to all my questions. Also, to all the students who joined in the study groups for their active participation and alternative perspectives. I was able to gain multiple insights I otherwise may not have gained towards the project without them. There is always strength in numbers.
